There cannot be a worse feeling than getting on stage in front of a bunch of strangers, trying to make them laugh and then hearing silence. Alternatively, the rush you get whenever you get roaring laughter is invigorating. I began my incredibly amateur career in standup comedy in 2019. I was hooked immediately.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>If you've ever tried speaking to someone who does standup comedy, you'll quickly realize they're a special breed. They tend to be a little socially awkward, very disorganized and have no idea when or where anything is happening. I wanted to create an application that could help these individuals become better.</p>\n                        <h3 >The Problem</h3>\n                        <p>How can I help comedians improve their craft, create connections and ultimately succeed?</p>\n                        <h3 >The Solution</h3>\n                        <p>I decided to create a journal of sorts. The main journal component would have two parts. The first would be a place for comedians to workshop material they hadn't fully fleshed out yet with help from other users. the second would be a place where they could post videos of their previous performances, make notes and receive feedback from other users. There would be a messaging feature, an events page and a place to become friends with other users.</p>\n                        <h3 >Challenges</h3>\n                        <p>3 months before starting this project, I was anxious that when I was writing HTML I would use a Div where I should've used a Section. Now I'm going to be coding a proper website by myself in ReactJS, which I had started to learn 3 weeks prior. I was excited and nervous, but felt up to the task.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>I had previous practice with creating forms and displaying information from them, but the way I envisioned the messaging feature working would be different. I wanted it to be similar to a Facebook feed, with one input at the top and the messages cascading down. I was unsure of how the code would work for this part.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>The friend feature seemed to be the most daunting. I did not understand what it meant that I'd be creating an object that represented a friendship. I also had no idea how to get two keys in the object to represent a friendship. It was all very confusing to me.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <h3 >The Design Process</h3>\n                    </Col>\n                </Row>\n                <Row className=\"justify-content-md-center\">\n                    <Col lg={12}>\n                        <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={LTWire} width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"The wireframe for laugh track\" />\n                        <p>Want a better view of the wireframe? <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/0DAt4BzQJH1jioAxM5gFWc/Laugh-Track?node-id=0%3A1&viewport=357%2C210%2C0.20582306385040283\" target=\"_blank\">Click here.</a></p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>The design process was not my best showing. I learned the importance of planning, here. My overall site design ended up looking pretty different to what I planned, since all I had planned was a wireframe. This was a lesson where I learned utilizing a mock up is very important. Trying to design while in a development mindset can, and did, lead to lots of careless mistakes.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>I wanted to use a style library for this project because I knew it would be important in my future to learn how to use one properly. I landed on the <a href=\"https://react.semantic-ui.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Semantic UI React library</a>. I really chose it based off the buttons and input styles and there wasn't too much thought besides that.</p>\n                        <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={Kellen} width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Kellen's user profile\" />\n                        <p>I used the persona of Kellen to guide my process. He was, in my mind, the typical user. He's ambitious, a dreamer, but has few of the necessary skills needed to become a full-time comedian.</p>\n                    </Col>\n                    <Col lg={12}>\n                        <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={ERD} width=\"80%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"The ERD for laugh track\" />\n                        <p>The ERD was another pain point for me. I learned quickly that this is a place to take your time and get it right. I did not and wasted a decent amount of time fixing my mistakes in the database. It's not sexy or attractive, but it is worthwhile.</p>\n                <Row className=\"justify-content-md-center\">\n                    <Col>\n                        <h3 >Coding</h3>\n                        <p>I was nervous to start, but decided to get things started with what I knew how to do. I made a homepage with a nav bar. I filled out a database with temporary information and got it working. I listed out that information on pages. The messaging feature ended up being more simple than I was afraid of, just a matter of fetching, listing and a simple form. A huge relief, you can imagine.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>The first struggle I encountered was creating friends. I had all of the users laid out, but didn't quite know how to translate users to friends.</p>\n                        <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={code} width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"add user button\" />\n                        <br />\n                        <p>admittedly I'm writing this case study 3 months later, and this is not how I would write it today. There's definitely some redundant data. But I was proud of myself! I organized the data so the active user was not the userId. That was because if I did the opposite and fetched from that data, the active user would show in their own friend's list. I felt clever and like I had conquered a previously inconceivable task.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>Related to the friends, I wanted to make sure that if you added a user as a friend, they wouldn't show in the user list again. I knew this would entail the use of a filter function, and I was intimidated. It took a while to grasp, and I even did a few tutorials to try to understand the filter function better, but I got it working!</p>\n                        <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={codeProud} width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"add user button\" />\n                        <br />\n                        <h3 >Wrapping Up</h3>\n                        <p>Looking back, if I did this project again I would do it very differently. There would be more UI/UX planning, I would have done a mock up, user testing and made different design choices entirely. But I'm still very proud of this social media I created. It was my first big solo project and set me up well to learn more in the second half of my class. The mistakes, the triumphs and the lessons were all worthwhile. </p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>I have looked back at this project many times and every time I have the thought \"I should change the way that looks.\" But I'm not going to.

You get changed into your comfiest clothes, get your favorite snack and a drink, and find the softest spot on the couch. Then, for the next 2 hours, you and your friend argue about what to watch. It’s exhausting. No one can agree on what they want. And at the end of the argument, you end up picking a movie neither of you are excited about. It's enough to ruin an otherwise perfect night.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>This project was my backend capstone for the Nashville Software School. Since my last capstone, I had taken 2 months of classes on UI/UX Design. This project would have things previous projects had - user personas, ERD’s and wireframes - but it would need more to make it a true UI/UX project.</p>\n                        <h3 >The Problem</h3>\n                        <p>How can I build an application that helps users waste less time deciding what to watch?</p>\n                        <h3 >The Solution</h3>\n                        <p>I wanted to create a Tinder-esque application where, rather than swiping through a list of potential romantic partners, users are presented with a move or tv show they can show interest in our toss aside. From there, users can compare their liked movies and show with their friends and see what movies and shows both users have in common. </p>\n                        <h3 >Challenges</h3>\n                        <p>This was a big project. I had the idea around the time I started at NSS, but around the time of my first capstone I knew I couldn’t get anywhere near making it work. Come time for my second and I was still intimidated. This was a 3 week sprint, and if I did not finish I did not graduate. I knew I’d have to put in overtime, but I was ready. </p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>I knew from the beginning that this project was going to be tough. Even in the research phase before I created a single wireframe, I hit a road bump. Netflix has an API, however, they limited access to that API in 2013. I attempted to gain access, but to no avail. </p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>The Tinder swipe was the most intriguing piece. Creating a reliable swipe function seemed outside of the scope of my knowledge and, given the 3 week time-span, I did not believe I had time to learn and have time left to make the rest of the application. I would be forced to turn to a third party plugin that would allow for the functionality, and those always have dragons hiding in the code waiting to be fought.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>I was going to implement Firebase into my application so users could sign in with Google. I wanted to use the database that Firebase offered so any user anywhere could use the site. It would lose purpose if you couldn’t find friends who were also using the app.</p>\n                        <h3 >The Design Process</h3>\n                        <p>I was so excited for my project that I needed up starting 2 weeks early. I wanted to make sure I made a good website. I started with the wireframe.</p>\n                    </Col>\n                </Row>\n                <Row className=\"justify-content-md-center\">\n                    <Col lg={12}>\n                        <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={OFWire} width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"The wireframe for ourflix\" />\n                        <p>Want a better view of the wireframe? <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/xasfgEcT81lBbrkNJzNupf/Capstone?node-id=0%3A1\" target=\"_blank\">Click here.</a></p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>The format really fell into place. The tinder layout simplified things, present a user with an option and let them choose. Easy enough! How to lay out information about the movie was the only hesitancy I had, but ultimately decided that movie posters typically give you enough information on first glance, but I needed to give an option to see more if it wasn’t abundantly clear.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>Defining who my users would be was my next step. I created two personas, one being a twenty-something adult female and the other being a forty-ish dad. They seemed different enough to really catch who the user base might be and what their motives were.</p>\n                    </Col>\n                    <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={MarkUP} width=\"80%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"The ERD for ourflix\" />\n                    <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={CaroUP} width=\"80%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"The ERD for ourflix\" />\n                    <Col lg={12}>\n                        <p>The journey of selecting a movie was an important mindset to step into.

I knew I could create a color sceme that might look nice, but I wanted another challenge. I decided to stay within Netflix’s style guides. I wanted to use the same fonts, colors, buttons and everything else that Netflix does. Staying within the bounds of another company’s guidelines is what I’ll be doing in my career, might as well start here</p>\n                        <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={mockup} width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Ourflix Mockup\" />\n                        <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={mobilemockup} width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Ourflix Mockup\" />\n\n                        <p>I made 2 mock ups for the site, knowing that while I was creating a website on desktop, this would typically be accessed by a smart phone. It makes sense given the target demographics are much more heavy phone users than desktop.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>Largely, the design did not change much between the wireframe and mockup. I added in color, changed the fonts and smaller tweaks. I made the mock up into a prototype and commenced user testing in the mobile mock up.</p>\n                    </Col>\n                </Row>\n                <Row>\n                    <Col>\n                        <h3 >User Testing</h3>\n                        <p>In user testing, I, like many other designers, found that my design was not as intuitive as I had believed it was. Users who had never used a dating app were confused about which way to swipe. They revealed that the thumbs up and thumbs down conveyed a rating rather than an interest level. They would get to the end of the list of movies and not know what to do next.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>I was excited to address the changes and begin a second round of testing. I implemented a tutorial at the beginning that seemed to clear the air. I replaced the thumbs up and down with a check mark and an X. I made the navigation a bit more obvious so it drew the eye. The solutions weren’t perfect, but they worked!</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>Check out the final mockup. I was excited to continue the improvements, but unfortunately hit the end of my timebox. I needed to start coding or I would never finish the app. I decided that with any spare time, I could user test with my MVP.</p>\n                        <iframe title=\"ourflix mockup\" id=\"figma\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F6tnC0anMq2RAgidbGWjTAP%2FOF-Mock%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1\" allowFullScreen></iframe>                        <h3 >Coding</h3>\n                        <p>It was time to code, and I was pretty excited. I knew there was a ton of work, but the idea was so fun that I was excited to tackle it all. The app was written in React and used the React-Bootstrap component library. I have grown to thoroughly enjoy both, this portfolio site uses both of those as well.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>Not having the Netflix API was a setback, but there were alternatives. I found the <a href=\"https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogsng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">unongs API</a> that has, as far as I know, an updated catalogue of titles. Issues arose when I realized the API took 10 seconds to fetch the data. For the sake of education, I made a copy of the API. I had no intent of distributing or making a financial gain on the site so I felt it was ok. The image quality was still low, but finding posters that would fit the size format was difficult and I could not spare the time to search for ones that did. It also limited my ability to filter due to the fact that most of that information was not included in the database. Minor setbacks, but largely a win.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>The Tinder swipe was solved with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tinder-card\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">React Tinder Card by Jakob Unnebäck</a>. It had the best functionality I found, but still had shortcomings. The buttons would have to be sacrificed due to limitations with the way the code worked. They would swipe the card, but the movie or show would not be liked or disliked. It was too large of a flaw to work around, but the swipe worked just as I had hoped.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>Firebase took a lot of time to figure out. I am used to RESTful API calls where you can embed and expand given the ID in one data subset matched the naming of another. However, Firebase’s realtime database does not allow for that. I am quite proud of the workaround I figured out.</p>\n                        <Image id=\"user-prof\" src={code} width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Fetch call from firebase\" />\n                        <p>As you can see, I grew very familiar with Object.keys, Object.values and Object.entries.

I have never struggled more with code than I did here, but I have also never learned as much than I did with this project. For every struggle, there were 5 more moments where I felt like I triumphed.</p>\n                        <br />\n                        <p>The end result does not look like the mockup. I wish it did. But I’m still very proud of this project. I had valuable practice with UI/UX techniques, I learned about promises with fetch calls, I learned how to use Firebase. I never would have known that without this project. I’m not finished with it, either. I want to work on this project more and keep learning from it. I want to get the buttons figured out, I want to add groups, I want to make this application as great as it can be.</p>\n                        <br />\n                    </Col>\n                </Row>\n            </Container>\n        </div >\n\n    )\n}",{"ruleId":"93","replacedBy":"94"},{"ruleId":"95","replacedBy":"96"},{"ruleId":"97","severity":1,"message":"98","line":11,"column":8,"nodeType":"99","messageId":"100","endLine":11,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"97","severity":1,"message":"101","line":11,"column":10,"nodeType":"99","messageId":"100","endLine":11,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"102","severity":1,"message":"103","line":35,"column":25,"nodeType":"104","endLine":35,"endColumn":205},{"ruleId":"102","severity":1,"message":"103","line":49,"column":25,"nodeType":"104","endLine":49,"endColumn":263},{"ruleId":"97","severity":1,"message":"105","line":12,"column":18,"nodeType":"99","messageId":"100","endLine":12,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"106","severity":1,"message":"107","line":66,"column":192,"nodeType":"108","endLine":66,"endColumn":207},{"ruleId":"97","severity":1,"message":"109","line":11,"column":8,"nodeType":"99","messageId":"100","endLine":11,"endColumn":20},{"ruleId":"97","severity":1,"message":"110","line":6,"column":18,"nodeType":"99","messageId":"100","endLine":6,"endColumn":23},{"ruleId":"106","severity":1,"message":"107","line":75,"column":148,"nodeType":"108","endLine":75,"endColumn":163},"no-native-reassign",["111"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["112"],"no-unused-vars","'thumbs' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'JournalCS' is defined but never used.","jsx-a11y/iframe-has-title","<iframe> elements must have a unique title property.","JSXOpeningElement","'Carousel' is defined but never used.","react/jsx-no-target-blank","Using target=\"_blank\" without rel=\"noreferrer\" is a security risk: see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-noopener","JSXAttribute","'Journalphoto' is defined but never used.","'Image' is defined but never used.","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
